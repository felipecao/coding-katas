### How do I run this?

As the problem description doesn't specify any input media, the solution works based on acceptance tests. So, in order to run the tests, install Scala (http://www.scala-lang.org/) and afterwards install SBT (http://www.scala-sbt.org/). Both can be installed via different package managers, like Homebrew (http://brew.sh/), SDKMAN! (http://sdkman.io/) and many others.

Once you have both installed, open your favourite shell, go to this project's root folder and run `sbt test`. All tests will be executed and a nice test summary will be printed in the console.
