# Kata: Find the sub sets

You're given two inputs: a positive integer x and an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the subset(s) of A whose sum is **closest** but not bigger than x. The order of the output does not matter, but you should return all possible solutions.

For example:
```
x = 29
A = [2, 8, 3, 9, 11]

output = [8, 9, 11]
```

The sum is **28**, which is the closest you can get to x.

#### Bonus
Accept all integers, not just positive ones.

#### Running the tests
Just open a terminal and run `./gradlew clean test`
