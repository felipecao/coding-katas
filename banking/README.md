##  Starting Points
* github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps (Java, JS, Ruby, Python, Scala)
* github.com/coreyhaines/coderetreat/tree/master/starting_points (9 more languages)

##  Your Task
Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software and they hired both of you for a greenfield project in - what a happy coincidence - your favorite programming language!

Your task is to show them that your TDD-fu and your new-age programming language can cope with good ole’ COBOL!
 

##  Requirements
* An Account should have means to process a Deposit and Withdrawal
* Print an ASCII Account statement (date, transaction amount, balance after transaction)
* **BONUS**: It should be possible to transfer money between two accounts

**Not important**: Conversion between Currencies. An Account should only process transactions with the currency it was setup with.


##  The Rules

* One level of indentation per method
* Don’t use the ELSE keyword
* Wrap all primitives and Strings
* First class collections
* One dot per line
* Don’t abbreviate
* Keep all entities small (50 lines)
* No classes with more than two instance variables
* BONUS: No getters/setters/properties

### Spotlight: Grace Hopper

COBOL was designed in 1959, by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to as "the (grand)mother of COBOL".
“United States Navy Admiral Grace Hopper (1906–1992) was one of the first programmers in the history of computers. Her belief that programming languages should be as easily understood as English was highly influential on the development of one of the first programming languages called COBOL. It is largely due to Grace Hopper’s influence that programmers use “if/thens” instead of 1s and 0s today.”
